6' 150lb so I'm tall and heavy enough to reach the ground. CS Major and Minoring in Industrial Engineering and Business Analytics. 20. 
Currently an undergraduate in my junior year. 
I love music, so basically if you have any music to share please do not hesitate to send it my way. 
I'm a pretty positive person, so basically I'm always up to hear a good joke.
Oh yeah, and I like okie dokie popcorn, so let's have an okie dokie kinda party.

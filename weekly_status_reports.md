# Weekly Status Reports

## Week One:
Sohum Mehrotra:

This week I created and set up the git repository for our team.  I developed and formatted our team web page.  I created my bio.  I created the weekly status reports page. I did some light research to discover Chicago land data in the apartment pricing sphere.  I plan to do more research in the upcoming week to find concrete data to make interesting observations about this data in the future.  A block that we are having is that we are not all focused on the same task, so our research is scattered.

Janelle Cueto:
This week I updated my bio for our team page. I also did some research around flights and pricing from Chicago to other major cities as well as looked into apartment search sites such as Zillow and Trilio to research what spaces are available in the Chicago area. I also researched hotels in the downtown Chicago area to compare pricing during spring break, and I found myself also looking greatly into each hotel's ratings and reviews. In the upcoming week, I plan to refine my own observations from the data I can obtain from common travel and lodging sites and I want to find sources for data sets that we'll extract data from later on. A block that I think we can easily resolve this week is that the team needs to get on the same page and we just need to meet together to decide how we'll move forward in terms of group work.

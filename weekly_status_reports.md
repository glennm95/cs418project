# Weekly Status Reports
### [Main Page](https://nuknuk48.github.io/cs418project/)
## Week One:
Sohum Mehrotra:

This week I created and set up the git repository for our team.  I developed and formatted our team web page.  I created my bio.  I created the weekly status reports page. I did some light research to discover Chicago land data in the apartment pricing sphere.  I plan to do more research in the upcoming week to find concrete data to make interesting observations about this data in the future.  A block that we are having is that we are not all focused on the same task, so our research is scattered.

Janelle Cueto:

This week I updated my bio for our team page. I also did some research around flights and pricing from Chicago to other major cities as well as looked into apartment search sites such as Zillow and Trilio to research what spaces are available in the Chicago area. I also researched hotels in the downtown Chicago area to compare pricing during spring break, and I found myself also looking greatly into each hotel's ratings and reviews. In the upcoming week, I plan to refine my own observations from the data I can obtain from common travel and lodging sites and I want to find sources for data sets that we'll extract data from later on. A block that I think we can easily resolve this week is that the team needs to get on the same page and we just need to meet together to decide how we'll move forward in terms of group work. 

Brandon Goodman Gibis:

This week I updated my bio for our team page. I researched Health reports in the city of Chicago, specifically Morbidity and Clinical Care of the population from the Chicago Health Atlas. Next week I plan on finding 1-2 more sources, 1 on Health reports and 1 on another category. One issue I noticed was that the data on the Health reports from the website I used was very brief. I hope to find a more extensive source to use for our project.

Glenn Mascarenhas:

For the 1st week I added my bio to the our project webpage and I looked for data sets that are related to the city of Chicago. Being an aviation enthusiast, I searched for data related to Chicago's O'Hare airport and I came across the Chicago Deparment of Aviation's website: flychicago.com which is not only responsible for providing basic arrival/departure information of flights at O'Hare and Midway, but also maintains statistical data on the monthly aircraft operations, passenger volumes and cargo tonnage at both these airports. My challenge for week 2 would be to analyze this data, and figure out what aspects make it a good candidate to be used in Data Science. I would also look for the useful information that I can extract from it, which could give an insight to the CDA and could be used to predict future growth/ decline in each of the above mentioned sectors and the factors affecting them. I noticed that the data is available as pdf files for each month (for a period of 18 years) so I might not be able to use this data directly in the format provided as it would be tough to manipulate it. Besides this, I'm also in search for other interesting datasets that can be added to the Data Discovery deliverable of week 2.

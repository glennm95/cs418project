# Weekly Status Reports

## Week One:
Sohum Mehrotra:

This week I created and set up the git repository for our team.  I developed and formatted our team web page.  I created my bio.  I created the weekly status reports page. I did some light research to discover Chicago land data in the apartment pricing sphere.  I plan to do more research in the upcoming week to find concrete data to make interesting observations about this data in the future.  A block that we are having is that we are not all focused on the same task, so our research is scattered.
